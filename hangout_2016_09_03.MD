[0:00:34](https://soundcloud.com/gridcoin-community-hangouts/5th-hangout#t=0:34) charities
* [The Water Project](https://thewaterproject.org)
  * they accept already Bitcoins (just via static address, no payment processor)
  * so, let's make them put up a Gridcoin donate button (or only a static GRC address people can send them GRCs to)
  * another option: donations to the charity by us
* WCG has also a water project
* project: [girls who code](https://girlswhocode.com)
* why should a charity accept GRC when they already do BTC ? 
  * they might say: just give us BTC
  * but when we tie it to a specific BOINC project (where all computed power goes to donation) or charity pool (or option in pool like: "want to give x % of my earnings to charity + select which charity to give it to") they might be much more willing
* foundation funds: in general spend less now to save for future, example was about paying devs
* charity pool (0:19:00-)
* see task: [gather list of charities that accept Bitcoin (+ make them accept Gridcoin also)](https://github.com/Erkan-Yilmaz/Gridcoin-tasks/issues/62)

 * discussing how the poll should be worded (also so the outvoted projects would not need a new whitelist poll to come in)
* security procedures, tips:
  * what to do: in case a BOINC project gets hacked, distribute malware
  * ask BOINC admins about their security methods (e.g. invite to mumble), e.g. also in [BOINC project whitelist guidelines/checklist](https://cryptocointalk.com/topic/51660-requesting-peer-review-boinc-project-whitelist-guidelineschecklist/)

***

[1:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/gridcoin-community-hangouts/5th-hangout#t=1:15:30) polls:
* SSL: how to do the voting? all projects at once
* magnitude + balance weight, which ratio should it be ?
  * one user said like: proletariat vs bourgeois ? users that have only past in their interest vs users who have the future in view ?
* voting participation too low in votes so far, and dangers of this
  * e.g. a pool in future can outweight decisions
