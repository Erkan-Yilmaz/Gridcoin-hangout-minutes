# Gridcoin Community Hangout #021

A massive shout out to the BeyondBitcoin community & @officialfuzzy for providing the Gridcoin community a room in their mumble server for free.

Another massive thanks to @peppernrino for editing the hangout recordings! Follow him on Steem! :D

## What is Gridcoin?

Gridcoin securely rewards BOINC computation on top of Proof of Stake. Reward allocation is distributed, not centralized unlike other distributed computing related cryptocurrencies.

## Past episode details
<a href="https://steemit.com/gridcoin/@cm-steem/gridcoin-community-hangout-020-24th-dec-2016-9pm-gmt-rsvp-and-suggest-topics">020 RSVP & Topic suggestion thread</a>

## Why are we holding these hangouts?
* A mumble conference call can provide significant advantages over communicating via forums and IRC.
* To create opportunities to inform the public of new Gridcoin, BOINC and related services & their development progress.
* To bridge relations between the cryptocurrency & BOINC communities.

## How long will the hangout last?

If there are not many topics suggested then hangouts won't last longer than an hour, on the other hand if there are many topic suggested then the hangout may last 2-3 hours!

When the Gridcoin Community Hangouts start really picking up traction we can become more strict with allocated speaking time if need be (so you're not waiting hours to talk).

## Want to suggest a topic to discuss?

Reply with your suggestions in this Steem post & order of discussion will be from highest to lowest voted suggestions.

## Can we discuss anything?

It's advisable to stay generally on topic, attendees are distributed around the world so they may not (likely won't) share the same views regarding controversial topics not related to Gridcoin/BOINC/Cryptocurrency.

That said, this 'on topic' guideline fizzles away once official recording has ended & the hangout becomes a more relaxed environment.

## Proposed time for Gridcoin Hangout #018:

9PM GMT 07th Jan 2017.

[Compare 9PM GMT to your time zone!](http://everytimezone.com/#2017-01-07,540,c8l).
