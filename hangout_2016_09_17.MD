[0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/gridcoin-community-hangouts/7th-hangout#t=0:21)
* integration Gridcoin into BitShares platform
  * gives access to web wallets, Android wallets
* black swan event with [MPA](https://cryptofresh.com/a/GRIDCOIN) :-( due to massive Gridcoin value spike:
  * value of GRC was higher than the collateral backing the Gridcoin tokens: and this triggered an alarm
  * fixes ? hardfork of BitShares ? because no function to recover from such a black swan state
* but Openledger is progressing OK so far:
  * 1 GRC equals 1 asset of Open.GRC on OpenLedger
  * normally GRC is bound to BTC on all other exchanges, here now: one can exchange really against other coins without "going over BTC"
*mobile wallets status
  * Android probably more supported than iPhone
  * iPhone: use web wallets
