# What is BOINC?
[BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/BOINC/boinc/) volunteer oriented distributed computing grid. It's free, and harnesses the unused clock cycles from processors and graphics cards to attempt to cure cancer/aids/ebola/malaria, map the milkyway, fold proteins, search for extraterrestrial life, etc.

Currently, there are approx ***580,000*** active BOINC users & more than ***4 million*** registered accounts. There's ***serious*** computing power being untapped at the moment.

### What are some examples of existing BOINC projects?
* [World Community Grid](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/) : Attempting to solve Cancer, Ebola, Malaria, Zika, etc.
* [SETI@Home](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/) : Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).
* [GPUGRID](http://www.gpugrid.net/): Full-atom molecular simulations of proteins
* [Milkyway@home](http://milkyway.cs.rpi.edu/milkyway/) : Creation of a 3d map of the milkyway galaxy using data gathered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This project enables research in both astroinformatics and computer science.

[Examples of more whitelisted projects](https://gridcoin.us/Guides/whitelist.htm).

### How does Gridcoin benefit BOINC?
The Gridcoin network rewards BOINC volunteers on behalf of the whitelisted BOINC projects. As a result, more computation is pointed at their projects without costing the BOINC project admins a penny.

By comparison, a BOINC project admin would have to fork out serious cash to get an equal level of computing power out of [Maidsafe](https://maidsafe.net/)/[Golem](http://golemproject.net/)/etc.

### Who can make a BOINC project?
Anyone can create a BOINC project, there's no centralised authority that you are required to consult before creating a BOINC project.

### How can I make a BOINC project?
IMO, the easiest method of creating a BOINC project is to use the '[BOINC Server Docker](https://github.com/marius311/boinc-server-docker)' repo! It takes the majority of manual configuration out of the picture allowing you to focus on customization & the creation of your application/work units. 

The developer "[Marius Millea](https://github.com/marius311/)" ([Cosmology@Home](https://www.cosmologyathome.org/) dev) is very active, give him a shout if you run into issues w/ the docker container.

##### Outdated guides
* '[Creating BOINC projects (PDF)](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/boinc.pdf)'
* '[Project creation cookbook](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/CreateProjectCookbook)'
* '[Building BOINC and BOINC applications on linux](http://www.spy-hill.net/myers/help/boinc/boinc-on-linux.html)'

### There are three types of BOINC projects!

#### Volunteer/non-profit
* ***Scientists***: [Use BOINC to create a volunteer computing project](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/volunteer.php).
* ***Universities***: [Use BOINC to create a Virtual Campus Supercomputing Center](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/VirtualCampusSupercomputerCenter).
The majority of BOINC projects are volunteer/non-profit based projects.

#### Commercial/For-Profit
* ***Companies***: [Use BOINC for desktop Grid computing](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/dg.php).
Create a commercial BOINC project, charge customer to process their data and distribute ***x***% to BOINC crunchers & ***y***% to project admins/shareholders.

#### BOINC DAC (Theoretical)
A "[BOINC deentralized autonomous company](https://gridcoin.us/guides/bdac.htm)" is a theoretical extension on the 'Commercial/For-Profit' project type.

Further research&development is required to decentralize the BOINC web server stack.

##### Existing research (mostly storage decentralization, not 100% decentralized)
* [Optimizing the data distribution layer of BOINC with BitTorrent](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4536446&newsearch=true&queryText=boinc).
* [Attic: A Case Study for Distributing Data in BOINC Projects](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6009057&newsearch=true&queryText=boinc).
* [Extending the BOINC architecture using peer-to-peer application code exchange](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5993689&newsearch=true&queryText=boinc).

### BOINC vs Cloud computing platforms
#### Research papers
* [The cost of virtualization implementation in volunteer computing](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6914205&queryText=boinc&pageNumber=2&newsearch=true)
* [Increasing GP Computing Power for Free via Desktop GRID Computing and Virtualization](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4912963&queryText=boinc&pageNumber=2&newsearch=true)
* [[PDF] Cost-Benefit Analysis of Cloud Computing versus Desktop Grids](http://mescal.imag.fr/membres/derrick.kondo/pubs/kondo_hcw09.pdf)

#### TL;DR: (Note - 7 year old statistics!)
  * In the best-case scenario, hosts register at a rate of 124 cloud nodes per day.
  * The ratio of volunteer nodes needed to achieve the compute power of a small EC2 instance is about 2.83 active volunteer hosts to 1.
  * Effectively, with a commercial BOINC project, there exists the opportunity to create a cloud computing service without actually owning/providing the computing capabilities yourself. Imagine creating Azure at a fraction of the cost..

### Got an idea for a BOINC project?

Do you have an idea for a potential BOINC project, or do you have questions about either BOINC or Gridcoin? Reply below! You ***don't*** need to have the skills to implement the project, we want to hear all ideas! :)

I'll repost your ideas each month afterwards to immortalize the idea until it is created! ;D

Best regards,
CM.

Due to complexities in Steemit's reward mechanism, there is a 30 day maximum window for replying to threads. After 30 days have passed, the thread is effectively archived/dead. 

In order to continuously brainstorm possible BOINC projects this thread will be reposted every 30 days.
